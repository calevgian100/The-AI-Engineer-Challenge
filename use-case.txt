🔧 Problem Worth Solving
CrossFit athletes often struggle with recovery, especially when dealing with specific injuries or overuse. 
Most generic advice doesn’t account for the intensity of WODs or the unique needs of functional fitness athletes. 
They need fast, reliable, and personalized post-workout guidance that supports long-term performance and 
injury prevention.

🤖 Potential LLM Solution
A mobile app that:

Accepts input like today’s WOD, soreness level, or injury status (e.g. “shoulder rehab”, “knee strain”)

Returns LLM-generated recovery protocols (stretching, mobility, contrast therapy, etc.)

Suggests alternate workouts based on injury ("can't squat? Here's an upper-body EMOM")

Optionally tracks trends in injuries and flags overtraining risk

Integrates Firebase for auth, storage, and user logs. Built in Flutter for cross-platform mobile use.
